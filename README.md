## How to build

* Step 1: Create a Firebase project. 

Add an Android app to that, download `google-services.json` file and put it inside `/app` folder

* Step 2: HERE maps SDK

Make a `secret.properties` file in the root directory and add the following line:

```
HERE_API_KEY=YOUR_HERE_SDK_KEY
HERE_API_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_HERE_SDK_SECRET
```

And replace the `YOUR_HERE` with the keys you get from HERE maps SDK.

* Step 3: Build the project
* Step 4: Run the project
* Step 5: Enjoy the app
